# express-mongo-ts

I saw a lot of familiarity to no-SQL requirements on job boards, so I decided to give it a try, however, I think for almost all projects no-SQL is a bad choice! Let's see if this repo can change my mind.

_update_: I figured some benefits MongoDB provides, however, It doesn't seem as maintainable as SQL taught. I may use this template and mongo for a hobby project.

this is a fork from my [express-ts-template](https://github.com/shalior/express-ts-template)
